# task-app
Task App is a simple web application for managing tasks. It consists of a client-side application built with React and a server-side application built with NestJS.

# Getting Started
To get started with Task App, you'll need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. Once you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, you can run the following command to start the application:
`
docker-compose up --build
`
This command will build the Docker images for the client and server applications and start the containers. You can then access the application by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

# Development
If you want to develop the client or server applications, you can use the following commands to start the development servers:

`
cd client
npm start
`
`
cd server
npm start
`
These commands will start the development servers for the client and server applications, respectively. You can then access the client application by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser and the server application by navigating to http://localhost:4200 in your web browser.
